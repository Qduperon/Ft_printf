s : Print a string.
	Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0');
	if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written.
	If a precision is given, no null byte need be present;
	if the precision is not specified, or > than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.

S : same as ls (a pointer to wchar_t argument -> 16 bits wide instead of 8)

p : void pointer -> hexadecimal (as if by %#x or %#lx)

d : Print an integer as a signed decimal number.
	The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear;
	if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.
	The default precision is 1.
	When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

D : same as ld

i : integer (same as d)
	The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear;
	if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.
	The default precision is 1.
	When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

o : unsigned octal
	The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear;
	if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.
	The default precision is 1.
	When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

O : same as lo

u : Print an unsigned integer.
	The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear;
	if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.
	The default precision is 1.
	When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

U : same as lu ()

x : The letters abcdef are used for x conversions
	The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear;
	if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.
	The default precision is 1.
	When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

X : The letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions.
	The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of digits that must appear;
	if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.
	The default precision is 1.
	When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

c : Print a single character. (the int argument is converted to an unsigned char)

C : same as lc (a wint_t argument
	The wint_t (wide character) argument is converted to a multibyte sequence by
	a call to the wcrtomb(3) function, with a conversion state starting in the
	initial state, and the resulting multibyte string is written.

D, O, U are all length modifiers; l makes things as long /or wide characters

%% : imprime juste un '%'
